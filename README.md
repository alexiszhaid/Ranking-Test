# Ranking Test: Friedman Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of the Friedman test to analyze sensory data collected through a ranking test.

## Overview

In sensory science, the ranking test allows panelists to order multiple samples from most to least preferred. Since rankings are ordinal and not normally distributed, the Friedman test is a suitable non-parametric method for identifying significant differences between treatments.

This R Markdown document provides:

- A brief explanation of the ranking test and its statistical foundations.
- An example using data from a study in which 12 panelists evaluated four beverage formulations with varying ratios of mango pulp and passion fruit extract (75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100).
- R code using the `agricolae` package to run the Friedman test and post-hoc analysis.
- Graphical visualization of average ranks.
